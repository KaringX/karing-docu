# Custom diversion
- If the built-in geo(-ip, -site) and ACL rules cannot meet your needs, you can try `Custom diversion group` and `Custom proxy group/Custom Auto Select`

## Materials
- karing >= 1.0.15.133
- Brave 1.67.116
- Only used in the following cases

## Custom diversion group
- Here we use this function *to solve the problem that Brave translation function cannot be used in mainland China* as an example.

### Configuration steps
1. Add a diversion group
- Settings â€”> Diversion -> Diversion rules -> Edit -> `Custom diversion group` -> âž• in the upper right corner -> Click the first âž•, add a diversion group, and write a note brave
2. Add rules
- Return to the `Custom diversion group` list, select the note name just now
- Fill in the required rules, taking brave as an example:
- Fill in "translate.brave.com" in `Domain Suffix`, <font color="red">Note: Do not have `DEMO:` characters</font>
- Save in the upper left corner
- ![brave](./img/custom-diversion-1.png)

3. Select the rule matching action
- Return to the first screen of diversion rules, under the custom group, select brave (the note name of the rule just now)
- Select the action **Current selection**
- ![rules](./img/custom-diversion-2.png)
4. Return to the karing homepage and reconnect to make the settings effective
- Close the "Connect" button, then open the connection, the button background is green
5. Test if it works
- Open a page in brave browser, right click -> Translate
- Karing homepage -> Connection (ðŸ’» icon)
