# Custom Diversion/Proxy Group
- If the built-in geo (-ip, -site) and ACL rules do not meet your needs, you can try `Custom Diversion Group` and `Custom Proxy Group`.

## Requirements
- karing >= 1.0.15.133
- Brave 1.67.116
  - Only applicable for the following example

## Custom Diversion Group
- Here we use this feature to *solve the issue of Brave's translation function being unusable in Mainland China* as an example.

### Configuration Steps
1. Add Diversion Group
  - Settings â€”> Diversion -> `Custom Diversion Group` -> âž• icon in the upper right corner, add a diversion group, and write a remark like brave
2. Add Rules
  - Return to the `Custom Diversion Group` list, select the remark name you just created
  - Fill in the required rules, using brave as an example:
    - In `Domain Suffix`, enter "translate.brave.com"
    - Save with the checkmark in the upper left corner(âœ” icon)
    - ![brave](./img/custom-diversion-1.png)

3. Select Rule Matching Action
  - Settings â€”> Diversion -> `Diversion Rules` -> In the first screen under Custom Group, select brave (the remark name of the rule you just created)
  - Select action **Current Selected**
    - ![rules](./img/custom-diversion-2.png)
  - Return to karing homepage and reconnect to make the settings take effect
  - Turn off the "Connect" button, then turn it back on, and the button background should be green
4. Test if it works
  - Open a page in Brave browser, right-click -> Translate
  - karing homepage -> Connection (ðŸ’» icon)
    - ![connections](./img/custom-diversion-3.png)

**Note**: All data in the rules are case-sensitive
