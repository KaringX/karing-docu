# Backup and Sync
- karing supports multi-device sync configuration through the following methods:
  - Webdav
  - LAN sync
  - Import/Export zip files

## Method 1: Webdav
- Settings -> Backup and Sync -> `Webdav`
- Refer to your cloud storage documentation for specific server configuration

### AList
- Since it seems that only native Nutstore supports Webdav in China, you can use AList to implement Webdav
- Reference documentation:

- Exporter -> Option `Sync to Others` will generate a QR code
- Importer -> Option `Scan QR code to Sync`

## Method 3: File Import/Export
- Settings -> Backup and Sync -> LAN Sync -> `File Import/Export`
