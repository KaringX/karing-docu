## Question:

### Why does the traffic value on the chart suddenly drop and then rise again?

- Core reloading resets the traffic data, causing the traffic display to suddenly return to 0.

### What is the purpose of 'Data Anonymization'?

- Enabling 'Data Anonymization' will replace privacy information related to access history with '*' before storage. This function does not affect the 'Traffic Trend Chart', but it will affect the display of 'Request History'/'Traffic Trend Chart - Traffic Distribution Rules', etc.

## Note:
### An abnormal VPN process exit can prevent some data from being written to the database, resulting in data loss and potentially inaccurate data display.
